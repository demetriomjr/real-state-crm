# Create tests for current endpoints
- Create test for each endpoint in the `src/Application/Controllers/` folder.
    - Use nestJS standards to create Unit, Integration and E2E tests.
    - Make sure to log a text file at the end of the test run, with the results of the tests.
    - save the text file at `<root>/tests/results/` of the project.
        - Name the file as `test-<type of test>-<date>-<time>.txt`
